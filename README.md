# Fake IMEI For FF

**THIS PROJECT IS NO LONGER MAINTAINED**

Important: Android 10 and above cannot get IMEI anymore due to privacy changes https://developer.android.com/about/versions/10/privacy/changes

An app that generates random IMEI and saves the ffid.txt into /sdcard

Android 6.0 and up: Storage permission is required

To intergate ffid.txt to your APK, go to this project https://github.com/LGLTeam/FakeIMEI_Smali
